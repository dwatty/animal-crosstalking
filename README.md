# Animal Cross-talking

A test app for learning Angular - essentially an Animal Crossing themed version of Angular.io's "Tour of Heroes".

## Mock Server
The app uses JSON server (https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to provide a locally hosted API mock for returning data and persisting that data to the db.json file in the repo.

Run the Mock JSON server for handling the resident API requests.
```
npm run mockApi
```
